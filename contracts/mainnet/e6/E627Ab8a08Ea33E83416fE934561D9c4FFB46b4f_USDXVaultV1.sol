/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```solidity
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();

/**
 * @dev Implementation of the ERC4626 "Tokenized Vault Standard" as defined in
 * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626[EIP-4626].
 *
 * This extension allows the minting and burning of "shares" (represented using the ERC20 inheritance) in exchange for
 * underlying "assets" through standardized {deposit}, {mint}, {redeem} and {burn} workflows. This contract extends
 * the ERC20 standard. Any additional extensions included along it would affect the "shares" token represented by this
 * contract and not the "assets" token which is an independent contract.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * In empty (or nearly empty) ERC-4626 vaults, deposits are at high risk of being stolen through frontrunning
 * with a "donation" to the vault that inflates the price of a share. This is variously known as a donation or inflation
 * attack and is essentially a problem of slippage. Vault deployers can protect against this attack by making an initial
 * deposit of a non-trivial amount of the asset, such that price manipulation becomes infeasible. Withdrawals may
 * similarly be affected by slippage. Users can protect against this attack as well as unexpected slippage in general by
 * verifying the amount received is as expected, using a wrapper that performs these checks such as
 * https://github.com/fei-protocol/ERC4626#erc4626router-and-base[ERC4626Router].
 *
 * Since v4.9, this implementation uses virtual assets and shares to mitigate that risk. The `_decimalsOffset()`
 * corresponds to an offset in the decimal representation between the underlying asset's decimals and the vault
 * decimals. This offset also determines the rate of virtual shares to virtual assets in the vault, which itself
 * determines the initial exchange rate. While not fully preventing the attack, analysis shows that the default offset
 * (0) makes it non-profitable, as a result of the value being captured by the virtual shares (out of the attacker's
 * donation) matching the attacker's expected gains. With a larger offset, the attack becomes orders of magnitude more
 * expensive than it is profitable. More details about the underlying math can be found
 * xref:erc4626.adoc#inflation-attack[here].
 *
 * The drawback of this approach is that the virtual shares do capture (a very small) part of the value being accrued
 * to the vault. Also, if the vault experiences losses, the users try to exit the vault, the virtual shares and assets
 * will cause the first user to exit to experience reduced losses in detriment to the last users that will experience
 * bigger losses. Developers willing to revert back to the pre-v4.9 behavior just need to override the
 * `_convertToShares` and `_convertToAssets` functions.
 *
 * To learn more, check out our xref:ROOT:erc4626.adoc[ERC-4626 guide].

/**
 * @dev Interface of the ERC20 Permit extension allowing approvals to be made via signatures, as defined in
 * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612[EIP-2612].
 *
 * Adds the {permit} method, which can be used to change an account's ERC20 allowance (see {IERC20-allowance}) by
 * presenting a message signed by the account. By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't
 * need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all.
 *
 * ==== Security Considerations
 *
 * There are two important considerations concerning the use of `permit`. The first is that a valid permit signature
 * expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be
 * considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have
 * built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should
 * take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be
 * generally recommended is:
 *
 * ```solidity
 * function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {
 *     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}
 *     doThing(..., value);
 * }
 *
 * function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {
 *     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);
 *     ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of
 * `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also
 * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).
 *
 * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so
 * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.
