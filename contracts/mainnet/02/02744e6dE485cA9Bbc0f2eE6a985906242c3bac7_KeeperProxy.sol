/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();

// borrowing fees for position require only a borrowingFactor to track
// an example on how this works is if the global cumulativeBorrowingFactor is 10020%
// a position would be opened with borrowingFactor as 10020%
// after some time, if the cumulativeBorrowingFactor is updated to 10025% the position would
// owe 5% of the position size as borrowing fees
// the total pending borrowing fees of all positions is factored into the calculation of the pool value for LPs
// when a position is increased or decreased, the pending borrowing fees for the position is deducted from the position's
// collateral and transferred into the LP pool
//
// the same borrowing fee factor tracking cannot be applied for funding fees as those calculations consider pending funding fees
// based on the fiat value of the position sizes
//
// for example, if the price of the longToken is $2000 and a long position owes $200 in funding fees, the opposing short position
// claims the funding fees of 0.1 longToken ($200), if the price of the longToken changes to $4000 later, the long position would
// only owe 0.05 longToken ($200)
// this would result in differences between the amounts deducted and amounts paid out, for this reason, the actual token amounts
// to be deducted and to be paid out need to be tracked instead
//

// 1. long positions with market.longToken as collateral
