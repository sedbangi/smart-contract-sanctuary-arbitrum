 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as

 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To initialize the implementation contract, you can either invoke the
