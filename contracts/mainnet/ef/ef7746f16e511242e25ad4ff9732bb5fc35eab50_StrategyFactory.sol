 * @dev This contract implements a proxy that gets the implementation address for each call from an {UpgradeableBeacon}.
 *
 * The beacon address can only be set once during construction, and cannot be changed afterwards. It is stored in an
 * immutable variable to avoid unnecessary storage reads, and also in the beacon storage slot specified by
 * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1967[EIP1967] so that it can be accessed externally.
 *
 * CAUTION: Since the beacon address can never be changed, you must ensure that you either control the beacon, or trust
 * the beacon to not upgrade the implementation maliciously.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Do not use the implementation logic to modify the beacon storage slot. Doing so would leave the proxy in
 * an inconsistent state where the beacon storage slot does not match the beacon address.
